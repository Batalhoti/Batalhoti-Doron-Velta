I’ll try to list everything I’ve modified:

* Each side of the printer was moved 4mm further apart (i.e. 8mm increase in total from left to right);

* Added a cover to hide the 4020;

* Skirts printed in a single piece, opposed to the stock split configuration. Also with hexagonal pattern and an option with LED lighting;

* Rearrangement of the electronics from top and bottom for a 150W power supply;

* Some improvements to the toolhead and removal of the "Doron Velta" text from the front;

* Extruder with a filament sensor, along with the electronics, housed inside the printer;

* Filament output using a UBBI connector;

* New handle and hinges;

* Printed panels instead of  ACM to allow higher customization;

* Printed top panel with magnets for easier access to electronics;

* Servo-mounted support for the Klicky Probe;

* An amazing Doron cube in the shape of the printing area (thanks to Diem for the idea).
