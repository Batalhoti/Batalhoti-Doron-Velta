I’ll try to list everything I’ve modified:

* The printer was increased by 4mm on all sides;

* Added a cover to hide the 4020;

* Solid skirts with hexagonal patterns and an option with LED lighting;

* Reorganization of the electronics from top and bottom for a 150W power supply;

* Some improvements to the toolhead and removal of the "Doron Velta" text from the front;

* Extruder with a filament sensor, along with the electronics, housed inside the printer;

* Filament output using a UBBI connector;

* New handle and hinges;

* Printed internal panels;

* Printed top panel with magnets for easier access to electronics;

* Servo-mounted support for the Klicky Probe;

* An amazing Doron cube in the shape of the printing area (thanks to Diem for the idea).
